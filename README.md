# ForumGames
Hi evreyone. In this repository I would like to develop my project of Web Technology, a university course, for which I will  mostly use python with the Django package. The project is named "ForumGames" because its goal is to make a site where pc gamers can insert for example fps generated when run and also the components of the computer used.

---> As I already wrote, this project is only developed for the university. I will then leave all the information, such as those of security, written. <---

In this project left a pipfile for django installation when you download, you need to install pipenv and after install pipenv, you need to install django pipenv install django in this directory.
